        <h1>Hi, I'm Ziad Matar 👋</h1>
        <p>Junior DevOps Engineer & Full-Stack Developer</p>
        <p>
          I'm a computer science student in the AI department at Cairo
          University, with a deep passion for DevOps and Cloud technologies. I
          specialize in full-stack development, working primarily with the MERN
          stack. My focus is on building scalable, efficient web applications
          and automating infrastructure processes to help streamline operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my academic and practical experience, I have developed
          skills in cloud computing, containerization, CI/CD pipelines, and
          working with tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, MongoDB, Express,
          React, and Node.js. I am also well-versed in working with version
          control systems like Git, and I'm continually exploring new tools and
          methods to improve my workflows.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am committed to writing clean, maintainable code and collaborating
          effectively within teams. I am always seeking new opportunities to
          grow my skills and contribute to the success of tech-driven projects
          and organizations.
